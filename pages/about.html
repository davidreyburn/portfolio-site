            Welcome! My name is David Reyburn, and youâ€™ve reached my personal portfolio site, dreyburn.me. This website was created to showcase my previous projects in design, development, and programming; alongside descriptions of my skills and work experience for any client or employer interested in what my skills can do for you.
            
            <br>
            
            I've always been a problem solver; I can't stand to let an issue go when I have a solution in my head. It's this spirit of curiosity that's helped me in my roles in technical support and design, and it inspires me to seek fresh challenges. I am self motivated and constantly expanding my knowledge of technology, design, and human nature. My years of support experience enable me to communicate effectively with end users, find where the points of frustration are, and implement better workflows. This knowledge and experience, based in a solid research background that helps me ensure I'm solving the right problem instead of just responding to the crisis, is invaluable in helping me design and implement solutions that make the interactions between humans, computers, and applications happen as painlessly as possible.
