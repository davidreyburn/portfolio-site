                    <h3>The Project</h3>
                    In a previous support position I held, the organization's users had a problem. They were getting locked out on a daily basis, and were not able to use the tools available to unlock themselves, due to the fact that the tools were web-based and required a company machine to access, which they were of course locked out of.
                    <br>
                    Here, in order to expand my own skillset, I envisioned a better system for the users, starting with their cell phones.

                <div flex>
                    <h3>The Process</h3>
                    I began this process by developing the persona of "Ronnie Jackson" who represents a typical user at this organization; good at their jobs but not so great with computers and the endless passwords we all have to remember. Keeping Ronnie in mind helped me remember that a solution that is obvious to IT may not be so simple for others.
                    <br>
                    Since most everyone has used a smartphone now, and since they're typically more intuitive than a desktop, this made it an ideal platform for this tool. I created an interactive paper prototype for the app, and sought feedback from acquaintances in a similar user group to the persona. Their feedback was taken and used to inform tweaks in turning the app into a digital interactive prototype.

                    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                    Though this was only a personal project, were I to take it further, I'd bring this prototype to organization leadership to gather feedback for another iteration, and I'd also get the interactive prototype in front of users for usability testing. With this information, I'd be able to further refine the prototype and begin working with the development team on how to make it a reality.
