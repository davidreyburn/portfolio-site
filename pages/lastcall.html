                    <h3>The Brief</h3>
                    Last Call Trivia, a nationwide pub quiz league, needed a new site in preparation of the start of the spring 2017 trivia season. They wanted a modern, responsive site that displays important league information clearly, while remaining consistent with their recent brand redesign.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My role in the project was to design the layout of the site based on their existing branding guidelines, and to assist the frontend developer with implementing this design.

            <div style="display: flex; " layout="row" layout-xs="column" layout-padding>
                <div flex>
                    <h3>The Process</h3>
                    From using the old site for many trivia seasons, the client already had a pretty clear idea of how they wanted the navigation to look for the new one. My focus was on taking these ideas and bringing them to life in a way that captured the distinct look and feel of their branding for print materials.
                    <br>
                    After the designs were finalized, my role shifted to one of front-end development; working with the rest of the team to build a library of css components to easily apply the visual language of the designs to the rest of the website.
