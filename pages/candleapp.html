                    <h3>The Brief</h3>
                    SEA, Ltd. needed a solution for their candle safety performance testing facility. The laboratory technicians were doing their data collection on pen and paper and later transcribing the data into an Access database; a time-consuming process that introduced transcription errors. Management wanted to replace this inefficient method with the Candle App; a web application built for tablets that assists technicians in data collection and stores this data in a central database.

                    <br>
                    My role was to advocate for the users and help the dev team find elegant ways to make it easier and faster to accurately enter data.

                    <h3>The Process</h3>
                    Before even looking at the new application, my first goal on the Candle App project was to become an expert in old process of testing candles. This gave me first hand knowledge of the workflow used and the speed and accuracy required for the task. I observed experienced technicians at work in order to map out the process and guage the time taken for an experienced technician. Then, I timed myself on each step of the process to get the average time of a beginner. This would later prove useful in determining if the new system was saving any time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once I had the process mapped and understood, I began looking at the existing codebase for the Candle App and noted in which areas the app was not optimized for the technicians' workflow. I developed a list of possible enhancements to the app with accompanying wireframes, and iterated based on technician feedback. When I had a design the technicians were excited to use, I fleshed out a full interactive prototype and presented it to the project stakeholders, to be iterated further and then added to the action list.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    User feedback was closely monitored during the process of development to inform tweaks to the interface, colors, and page flow. A few months after the initial version 1.0 release of the app, I administered a user experience survey to guage our progress. This confirmed that most users felt the app was an improvement on the original process, though it also highlighted some key areas still in need of improvement. These areas became the subject of heuristic observation studies,

                    <h3>The Results</h3>
                    Version 1.0 of the app was launched in September 2016, right before the start of the busy season of testing seasonal and holiday candles. Though this was a high-pressure time to implement a change this size, the benefits were immediately apparent. Using the Candle App allowed all seasonal candles to be tested and processed without any delays, and without the need to hire additional seasonal staff; a first for the candle lab. Further iterations continued to make the app faster and easier to use.
