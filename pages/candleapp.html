                    <h3>The Brief</h3>
                    SEA, Ltd. needed a solution for their candle safety performance testing facility. The laboratory technicians were doing their data collection on pen and paper, and later transcribing the data into an Access database; a time-consuming process that introduced transcription errors. Management wanted to replace this inefficient method with the Candle App; a web application built for tablets that assists technicians in data collection and stores this data in a central database.

            The artifacts in this set of materials are from a project with SEA Ltd., which performs candle safety testing. A solution was needed to assist lab technicians with data collection in the candle testing facilities. The lab technicians had previously used a system of manually-written data that was later transcribed into a database, and this added significant additional time for data entry. In an effort to eliminate this data entry step and get data recorded and delivered to the client faster, candle lab management decided to look into a more automated solution, and the CART system was the result.
            The CART system comprises two main components: a web application used for collecting data throughout the process of testing a candle, and a physical cart which holds a tablet and data collection peripherals, to be used within the lab.In developing a solution for the candle lab, the development team sought to satisfy the following objectives:
            Eliminate the transcription stage of manually written data, saving time and reducing errors
            Develop an application that can run on a tablet & communicate with the various peripherals used in data collection
            Provide a solution for mounting the tablet and its associated peripherals on a medical cart which can easily and safely move through the testing laboratory, which can also power the devices through a technician’s entire shift
            Ensure that the app retains basic functionality even when taken offline due to internet outage or server issues, and can later synchronize data with the server
            Provide a user interface that allows data to be entered at least as fast as writing it down and also allows shortcuts, such as the ability to apply data points to multiple candles at once when applicable


            My role on the development team was a multidisciplinary one, encompassing UI research and design, software testing, and support. My responsibilities included the following:
            Acting as liaison between the development team and project stakeholders including candle lab management, third party clients who use the application, and candle lab technicians to determine what changes and new features are needed
            Creating mockups and prototypes for new features and iterating based on feedback
            Managing the list of bugfixes and action items for the development team
            Thoroughly testing the application before each new update to ensure functionality and reliability
            Coordinating with cadle lab technicians to perform user acceptance testing of updates prior to deployment
            Assembling CART system hardware, including finding solutions for mounting various peripherals
            Writing manuals and documentation for assembly of CART hardware and operation of the candle testing web app
            Additionally, this role required me to become an expert in the process of data collection in the previous system used by lab technicians, in effect receiving the training of a lab tech. This allowed me to “speak the language” of the occasionally complex system used in the candle lab, and to better empathize with and communicate the needs of the lab technicians. This provided valuable insights and was instrumental in creating a good user interface for the application.

            Process

            App enhancement recommendations were given to the project stakeholders during design briefings where they were discussed and iterated upon to guide future app development.. To develop these recommendations, I used the following process:

            First a journey map was created for the old manual process, and this was compared against the early version of the application to identify which parts of the old process could not be performed in the new system, or were not suitable for the fast-paced and detail oriented work in the candle lab. 
            Once key functionality and enhancements were identified, I would then produce wireframes of the features to discuss with users and project stakeholders. Feedback was taken, and the concept was iterated as needed. 
            A high-fidelity prototype was then produced based on the finalized design specification. In instances where specific interactions needed to be shown, an interactive prototype was created in IndigoStudio.
            This prototype was then included in a slide deck presentation or a design assessment document, along with specifications for the features and reasons for their importance in the app. This would be presented to project management, feedback would be taken, and the design would be further iterated if need be.
            After the recommendations were approved by management, they would be added to the list of action items, and I would then coordinate with the development team to estimate time and assign the item a priority level.

            Artifacts
            Included with this write up is a set of slide decks presented during design briefings used to introduce recommended app enhancements. 
            The “Duplicate Lot” presentation introduces a prototype which solves a request by the userbase to copy repetitively-entered information from one lot of candles to the next one. Here, “Lot” refers to 1 grouping of candles to be tested, which need to be labeled and then tested accurately throughout their lifespan.
            The “General Enhancements” presentation addresses 4 of the largest user pain points being experienced at that time throughout the interface, which were hindering the technicians in their goal of getting time sensitive data entered accurately.

            Please note that all screenshots in the presentation are wireframes simulated in IndigoFlow. Screenshots and code from production assets can be shown in person by request.
