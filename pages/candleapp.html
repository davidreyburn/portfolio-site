                    <h3>The Brief</h3>
                    SEA, Ltd. needed a solution for their candle safety performance testing facility. The laboratory technicians were doing their data collection on pen and paper, and later transcribing the data into an Access database; a time-consuming process that introduced transcription errors. Management wanted to replace this inefficient method with the Candle App; a web application built for tablets that assists technicians in data collection and stores this data in a central database.

                    My role in this project was to assist the dev team in the development process by studying the user's workflow and advocating for the design patterns which facilitate getting the data entered quickly and accurately.

                    <h3>The Process</h3>
                        Before even looking at the new application, my first goal on the Candle App project was to become an expert in the lab technicians' process of testing candles using the old system. This gave me first hand knowledge of the workflow used and the speed and accuracy required for the task, which was an invaluable perspective when arging for certain features or design patterns. Once I had learned the process sufficiently, I observed experienced technicians at work in order to formally map out the process and guage the time taken for an experienced technician. Then, I timed myself on each step of the process to get the average time of a beginner. This would prove useful later in determining if the new system was saving any time.

                    <br>
                        Once I had the process mapped and understood, I began looking at the existing codebase for the Candle App. Using my earlier training, I attempted to follow through the candle testing process on the new app, and in doing so was able to note in which areas the app was not optimized for the technicians' workflow. From these notes, I developed a list of possible enhancements to the app with accompanying wireframes, which were discussed with lead technicians and then iterated upon based on feedback. When I had a design the technicians were excited to use, I fleshed out a full interactive prototype and presented it to the project stakeholders. The recommendations would be iterated further based on feedback, and implementation of the design would be added to the developers' action list.

                    <br>
                        User feedback was closely monitored during the process of development, and used as the feedback for tweaks to the interface, colors, and page flow. A few months after the initial version 1.0 release of the app, I administered a user experience survey to guage our progress. This survey confirmed that most users felt the app was an improvement on the original process, though it also highlighted some key areas still in need of improvement. These areas were focused on in a series of heuristic observation studies of the technicians, and from here I again began the process of brainstorming solutions, iterating on those concepts, and presenting these ideas to the stakeholder team.
